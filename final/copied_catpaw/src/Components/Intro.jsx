					Naonao is a cat. &#9792; She's pretty. She's naughty. But I'm here to
					build a fanpage for her, as I love this naughty kitten! She was a
					homeless cat, and I found her crying loudly along the pavement on a
					cold, windy night. A worker next to the construction site told me
					that, it was left outside by someone else.

					I feel that this poor kitten couldn't survive the windy night, so I
					put her into my pocket, and I also bought her a can on my way home.

					You can Subscribe for Naonao's news updates, buy some badges, or play
					a tic-tac-toe with Naonao on her fanpage.
