                <p>Naonao is a cute kitten. She was a homeless cat. One windy night, I heard some voice along the
                    street. When I came near, I
                    thought it was a kitten.</p>
                <p>I love cats, but I never ever had one. So I decided to bring her home. In the first few days, she
                    could only drink sheep's milk. Several days later, I tried to give her some smashed cat food, and
                    add a little bit water inside. She enjoyed that!</p>
                <p>Naonao accompanied me during the three-months' quarantine. She sometimes bite me, and she often slept
                    on the floor when the weather was hot. When she get bored, she goes to play her tail and roll on the
                    floor.</p>
                <p>After I went to Northeastern University, my parents began to take care of her. They often told me
                    that Naonao enjoys sitting on my desk and smelling my slippers. I miss Naonao so much!</p>
